<h3> 💬 About Me: </h3>

My name is Iris Ailed Ramos Vivas, FullStack Developer student, Bussiness management and violinist passionate about arts. <br>
👩‍🎓 - Currently I'm student in Codeberry (Front-end) and in Generation (Java Fullstack Dev).<br>
🎻 - Also I'm violinist :) (work in progress)<br><br>
🍀 - I really love languages, I'm trying to learn 3 at the same time: english, german and french, the last two are the most difficult to me. <br>
💙 - I am constantly learning about programming so I think the most important thing here to me is the passion that I give to everything that I love, so, I'm open to learn about anything I'm interested in! 🌱
